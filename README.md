## Giving your valuables a digital identity

With this dapp you will be able to give all of your valuables a digital identity whether it's a tv, car, computer, wedding ring, etc. This will serve as your proof of ownership for these products through the Ethereum blockchain. This will make your valuables easier to recover when they go missing or are stolen. Rather than just creating a police report with a serial number and hoping they can search and recover the assets themselves, the public will also be able to identify these stolen assets by accessing the Ethereum blockchain and verifying ownership. This dapp will also raise confidence when purchasing per-owned products.
